DRAFT: This repo collects all the work I am currently conducting for my PhD. It is organised as follows:
- `Essen_Analysis` houses files used to test my melodic features software
  
- `Feature_Set` provides access to this melodic features software: run `pip install -e .` in the clone directory

- `PhDMelodySet.egg-info` helps with setup

- `RotationForest` contains a copy of a Python package for statistical analysis involved in the modelling work

- `modelling_paper` contains all scripts relevant to the Harvard MDT modelling I've done so far

This is very much a living repository and I can only apologise for the disorder - I will clean it up again soon!
