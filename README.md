DRAFT: This repo collects all the work I am currently conducting for my PhD. It is organised as follows:
- `Essen_Analysis` houses files used to test my melodic features software
- `Feature_Set` provides access to this melodic features software: this can be installed by running `pip install -e .` in the clone directory
